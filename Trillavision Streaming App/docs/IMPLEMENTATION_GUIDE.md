### Coding Standards

1. **TypeScript**: Use proper typing for all variables, functions, and components
2. **Component Structure**: Follow functional component pattern with hooks
3. **State Management**: Use Redux for global state, local state for component-specific state
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
5. **Performance**: Optimize rendering with memoization and proper dependency arrays
6. **Testing**: Write tests for critical functionality
7. **Logging**: Use structured logging with categories and levels

### Git Workflow

1. **Feature Branches**: Create a branch for each feature or bug fix
2. **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages with prefixes (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
3. **Pull Requests**: Create pull requests for code review
4. **Code Review**: Ensure all code is reviewed before merging

## Key Features Implementation

### YouTube Integration

The YouTube integration is implemented using the OAuth 2.0 flow:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User initiates connection to YouTube
   - Application redirects to YouTube authorization page
   - User grants permissions
   - YouTube redirects back with authorization code
   - Application exchanges code for access and refresh tokens
   - Tokens are securely stored for future use

2. **Service Layer**:
   - `YouTubeService` class manages all YouTube API interactions
   - Token management and storage
   - Broadcast creation and management
   - Stream status monitoring
   - Analytics data retrieval

3. **UI Components**:
   - `YouTubeAuth` component for initiating authentication
   - `YouTubeAuthCallback` component for handling OAuth callback
   - `YouTubeIntegration` page for managing YouTube settings
   - Integration with stream controls for seamless broadcasting

### Recording System

The recording system provides local recording functionality:

1. **Recording Manager**:
   - Manages recording sessions
   - Handles file naming and organization
   - Provides status updates
   - Supports multiple formats and quality settings
   - Implements split recording functionality

2. **UI Components**:
   - `RecordingPanel` for controlling recordings
   - Status indicators and file information
   - Quality settings configuration
   - Format selection

3. **Hooks**:
   - `useRecording` hook for managing recording state
   - Provides start, stop, and split functionality
   - Handles error states and cleanup

### Audio Processing

The audio processing system provides professional audio tools:

1. **Audio Processors**:
   - Compressor with visualization
   - Limiter with threshold control
   - Multi-band equalizer with interactive graph
   - Noise gate with threshold visualization
   - De-esser with frequency targeting

2. **Podcasting Mode**:
   - Dual microphone support
   - Independent gain control
   - Separate audio tracks
   - Optimized for conversation recording

3. **UI Components**:
   - `AudioMixer` for managing audio channels
   - Processor-specific components with visualizations
   - Preset management for saving and loading settings

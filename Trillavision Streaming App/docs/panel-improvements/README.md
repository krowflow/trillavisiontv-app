## Key Components

The panel system is built on several key components:

1. **PanelManager**: Manages the state and behavior of panels, including opening, closing, and replacing panels.
2. **PanelCard**: Wrapper component for panels with consistent styling and behavior.
3. **Card**: Base card component used by PanelCard.
4. **Tabs**: Component for creating tabbed interfaces within panels.

## Implementation Approach

Our approach to improving the panel card elements follows these principles:

1. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent styling, behavior, and organization across all panels.
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize space utilization with compact controls and better organization.
3. **Feedback**: Provide clear visual feedback for user actions and system status.
4. **Reusability**: Create reusable components and patterns to reduce code duplication.
5. **Maintainability**: Improve TypeScript usage and code organization for better maintainability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the panel improvements:

1. Review the [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md) for a high-level overview.
2. Dive into the [Codebase Analysis](codebase-analysis.md) for a detailed understanding of the current implementation.
3. Explore the [Panel Implementation Plan](panel-implementation-plan.md) for specific improvements to the three key panels.
4. Check the panel-specific documents for detailed improvements to each panel.

## Contributing

When contributing to the panel improvements:

1. Follow the established patterns and principles.
2. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across panels.
3. Use TypeScript properly with specific types.
4. Create reusable components and patterns where possible.
5. Test thoroughly for functionality and usability.

## Next Steps

The next steps for the panel improvements are:

1. Set up a GitHub repository for the project.
2. Implement the foundation improvements.
3. Proceed with panel-specific improvements.
4. Test and refine the implementation.
5. Document the final implementation.

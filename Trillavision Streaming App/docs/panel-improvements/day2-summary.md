## Implementation Timeline

| Component | Estimated Time | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Tabs Component | 4 hours | High |
| PanelCard Component | 8.5 hours | High |
| FormGroup Component | 1 hour | Medium |
| CompactInput Component | 1 hour | Medium |
| CompactSelect Component | 1 hour | Medium |
| StatusIndicator Component | 1 hour | Medium |
| CompactToggle Component | 1 hour | Medium |
| InlineEdit Component | 1 hour | Medium |
| Stream Controls Panel | 4 hours | High |
| Scene Transitions Panel | 4 hours | High |
| Stream Settings Panel | 4 hours | High |
| Testing and Refinement | 8 hours | High |

Total estimated time: 39.5 hours

## Key Considerations

1. **Maintain Current Design**
   - All enhancements must maintain the current design aesthetic
   - The purple and white color scheme should be preserved
   - The overall layout and structure should remain familiar to users

2. **Focus on Usability**
   - Improve space utilization in panels
   - Enhance visual feedback for user actions
   - Ensure all functionality remains accessible

3. **Code Quality**
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Add proper documentation
   - Create tests for all components

## Technical Approach

1. **Component-First Development**
   - Start with the base components (Tabs, PanelCard)
   - Then implement the reusable form components
   - Finally, update the panel-specific components

2. **Incremental Testing**
   - Test each component as it's implemented
   - Verify integration with existing components
   - Ensure proper styling and functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - Document all components with JSDoc comments
   - Create usage examples
   - Update implementation plans as needed

## Conclusion

We've made excellent progress on planning the panel improvements. The detailed plans for the Tabs component, PanelCard component, and reusable form components provide a solid foundation for implementation. By following these plans, we'll be able to create a more consistent, user-friendly interface while maintaining the current design aesthetic.

The next phase will focus on implementing these plans, starting with the base components and then moving on to the panel-specific improvements. With careful attention to detail and thorough testing, we'll be able to deliver high-quality improvements that enhance the user experience of the Trillavision Streaming App.

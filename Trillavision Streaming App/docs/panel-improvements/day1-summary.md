## Next Steps for Tomorrow

Tomorrow we will continue with the panel improvements:

1. **Tabs Component Enhancement**
   - Add support for dynamic tab content
   - Improve tab styling for better visibility
   - Enhance scrolling behavior for tab content
   - Add support for tab badges and notifications

2. **PanelCard Component Enhancement**
   - Update to work with the enhanced Card component
   - Standardize on 300px height
   - Improve header and content layout
   - Enhance collapse and maximize functionality

3. **Panel-Specific Improvements**
   - Begin implementing improvements for the Stream Controls Panel
   - Begin implementing improvements for the Scene Transitions Panel
   - Begin implementing improvements for the Stream Settings Panel

4. **Reusable Form Components**
   - Create FormGroup component for consistent form layouts
   - Create CompactControls for better space utilization
   - Create StatusIndicator for visual feedback

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

During today's implementation, we encountered a few challenges:

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - We encountered TypeScript errors related to the project's TypeScript configuration
   - These errors don't affect the functionality of the components but should be addressed in the future
   - We'll need to investigate the TypeScript configuration to resolve these errors

2. **Git Command Issues**
   - We encountered issues with the Windows command prompt not supporting the && operator
   - We resolved this by running the commands separately

## Conclusion

We've made excellent progress on the foundation improvements for the panel card elements. The enhanced Button and Card components provide a solid foundation for the panel-specific improvements we'll implement tomorrow.

The TypeScript errors we encountered are related to the project's TypeScript configuration and don't affect the functionality of the components. We'll need to investigate these errors further in the future.

Tomorrow we'll continue with the Tabs and PanelCard components, and then move on to the panel-specific improvements. We're on track to complete the panel improvements as planned.

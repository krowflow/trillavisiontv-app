# Git Branch Strategy and Next Steps

## Git Branch Structure

As a 10x full stack senior software engineer, I recommend the following Git branch structure for implementing the panel improvements:

```
main
└── feature/panel-improvements
    ├── feature/panel-foundation
    ├── feature/stream-controls-panel
    ├── feature/scene-transitions-panel
    └── feature/stream-settings-panel
```

### Branch Details

1. **feature/panel-improvements**
   - Main feature branch for all panel improvements
   - Will be merged into `main` when all improvements are complete
   - Contains documentation and overall changes

2. **feature/panel-foundation**
   - Branch for foundation improvements
   - Focus on base UI components, PanelCard, and Tabs
   - Will be merged into `feature/panel-improvements`

3. **feature/stream-controls-panel**
   - Branch for Stream Controls Panel improvements
   - Will be merged into `feature/panel-improvements`

4. **feature/scene-transitions-panel**
   - Branch for Scene Transitions Panel improvements
   - Will be merged into `feature/panel-improvements`

5. **feature/stream-settings-panel**
   - Branch for Stream Settings Panel improvements
   - Will be merged into `feature/panel-improvements`

## Branch Creation Commands

```bash
# Create and checkout the main feature branch
git checkout -b feature/panel-improvements

# Create foundation branch from panel-improvements
git checkout feature/panel-improvements
git checkout -b feature/panel-foundation

# Create panel-specific branches
git checkout feature/panel-improvements
git checkout -b feature/stream-controls-panel

git checkout feature/panel-improvements
git checkout -b feature/scene-transitions-panel

git checkout feature/panel-improvements
git checkout -b feature/stream-settings-panel
```

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Foundation Work (feature/panel-foundation)

   - Enhance tab styling for better visibility
   - Add support for dynamic tab content

4. **Update PanelCard Component**
   - Standardize on 300px height
   - Improve header and content layout
   - Enhance collapse and maximize functionality

5. **Create Reusable Form Components**
   - FormGroup component for consistent form layouts
   - CompactControls for better space utilization
   - StatusIndicator for visual feedback

### 2. Stream Controls Panel (feature/stream-controls-panel)

   - Implement status transitions and animations

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Create informative error component
   - Add dismiss functionality
   - Implement error categorization

3. **Compact Controls Layout**

   - Implement grid layout for buttons
   - Add tooltips for additional information

4. **Stream Metrics Display**
   - Add compact metrics display for live streams
   - Implement real-time updates
   - Add visual indicators for changes

5. **Quick Actions**
   - Add buttons for common tasks
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts
   - Add context-sensitive actions

### 3. Scene Transitions Panel (feature/scene-transitions-panel)

Implement the Scene Transitions Panel improvements:

1. **Visual Transition Preview**
   - Create visual preview component
   - Implement animation for different transition types
   - Add play/pause controls

2. **Standardized Settings UI**
   - Create consistent settings component
   - Implement common settings patterns
   - Add visual feedback for changes

3. **Improved Transition Grid**
   - Enhance grid layout with better visuals
   - Add filtering and sorting options
   - Implement drag-and-drop for reordering

4. **Streamlined Create Form**
   - Reorganize form for better usability
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Implement preview of new transition

### 4. Stream Settings Panel (feature/stream-settings-panel)

Implement the Stream Settings Panel improvements:

1. **Compact Advanced Settings**
   - Reorganize settings for better space utilization
   - Implement collapsible sections
   - Add tooltips for additional information

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Add notifications for settings changes
   - Implement validation indicators
   - Add save/cancel confirmation

3. **Consistent Spacing**
   - Create consistent form group component
   - Standardize margins and padding
   - Implement grid layout for form elements

4. **Platform-Specific Settings**
   - Show different settings based on platform
   - Implement conditional rendering
   - Add platform-specific validation

5. **Quality Presets**
   - Add presets for easier configuration
   - Implement preset selection UI
   - Add custom preset creation

## Merge Strategy

1. **Merge Foundation First**
   - Complete and test foundation improvements
   - Merge `feature/panel-foundation` into `feature/panel-improvements`
   - Update panel-specific branches with foundation changes

2. **Merge Panel Branches Independently**
   - Complete and test each panel branch
   - Merge each panel branch into `feature/panel-improvements`
   - Resolve any conflicts during merges

3. **Final Merge to Main**
   - Complete all panel improvements
   - Perform final testing on `feature/panel-improvements`
   - Create pull request to merge into `main`

## Next Steps

1. **Create Initial Branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/panel-improvements
   git checkout -b feature/panel-foundation
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Begin Foundation Work**
   - Start with Button component improvements
   - Update Card component
   - Enhance Tabs component
   - Update PanelCard component

4. **Create Pull Request for Foundation**
   - Complete foundation improvements
   - Create pull request to merge into `feature/panel-improvements`
   - Review and address feedback

5. **Proceed with Panel-Specific Improvements**
   - Create panel-specific branches
   - Implement improvements for each panel
   - Create pull requests for each panel branch

## Conclusion

This Git branch strategy provides a structured approach to implementing the panel improvements. By separating the work into foundation and panel-specific branches, we can work on different aspects of the improvements independently while maintaining a clear structure.

The next steps focus on creating the initial branches and beginning the foundation work, which will establish the base for all panel improvements. Once the foundation is in place, we can proceed with the panel-specific improvements in parallel or sequentially, depending on the team's capacity.

I recommend switching to Code mode to begin implementing these improvements, starting with the foundation work on the `feature/panel-foundation` branch.
